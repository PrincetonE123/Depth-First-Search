# Depth-First-Search

This is the prompt for the programming assignment given in class:
1)	[Part One] Design an interface for the user to provide information about nodes and edges for a directed graph; according to the user input, display the adjacency matrix and adjacency list of the graph.
2)	[Part Two] Run DFS on your graph and output all tracking tables (as discussed in class).


This how the program is ran:
First, the program asks the user for the number of verticies and edges. Then, the user inputs the verticies of each edge. After this, it outputs the Adjacency Matrix and the Adjacency List. Next, it prompts the user to enter the starting vertex. After this, the program outputs all of the Tracking Tables, which store the values of Vertex, Color, Predecessor, First-Time, and Last-Time. The last Tracking Table is the final Tracking Table.
